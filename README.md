BMI Calculator & Diabetes Predictor

This project combines Body Mass Index (BMI) analysis with Diabetes Prediction using machine learning models.
It provides a simple way to calculate BMI and leverages classification algorithms to predict whether a person is at risk of diabetes based on health parameters.

Features

✅ Calculate BMI from height & weight
✅ Predict diabetes risk using ML models

Algorithms implemented:

* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
* Naive Bayes

✅ Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis included

✅ User-friendly results for healthcare insights

📊 Dataset
